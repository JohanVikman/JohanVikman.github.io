A blog needs a theme.

This blog will have many themes.

Or categories.

One category is probably just journal entries. I need somewhere to
collect my thoughts, this is that category.

Another is technical, how to blog, and programming stuff. In my work I
read a lot (!) and I also write some. I want to become better at
writing, so there's that.

I also want to write about role playing games. Maybe I'll start there!
:D
